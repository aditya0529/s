o get Python 3.12 stable version on RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux), follow these steps:

Step 1: Enable the EPEL and RHSCL Repositories
First, you need to enable the EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) and RHSCL (Red Hat Software Collections) repositories, as Python 3.12 may not be available in the default RHEL repositories.

Enable EPEL:

bash
Copy code
sudo yum install epel-release -y
Enable RHSCL (if not already enabled):

bash
Copy code
sudo yum-config-manager --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms  # For RHEL 7
sudo yum-config-manager --enable rhel-8-appstream-rpms      # For RHEL 8
Step 2: Install Python 3.12 from Source
As of now, Python 3.12 may not yet be available in the standard repositories for RHEL, so youâ€™ll need to compile it from source.

Install Required Development Tools:

You need to install some tools and libraries required to build Python from source.

bash
Copy code
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools" -y
sudo yum install wget gcc openssl-devel bzip2-devel libffi-devel -y
Download Python 3.12 Source:

Download the stable release of Python 3.12 from the official Python website.

bash
Copy code
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.0/Python-3.12.0.tgz
Extract the Source Code:

Extract the downloaded tarball.

bash
Copy code
tar -xvf Python-3.12.0.tgz
cd Python-3.12.0
Build and Install Python 3.12:

Run the following commands to build and install Python 3.12.

bash
Copy code
./configure --enable-optimizations
make
sudo make altinstall
The --enable-optimizations flag enables several optimizations to make Python faster, but it will make the installation process take longer.

Note: Use make altinstall instead of make install to avoid overwriting the default system Python.

Verify the Installation:

After the installation, check the Python version to verify that Python 3.12 is installed.

bash
Copy code
python3.12 --version
Step 3: Set Python 3.12 as the Default Version (Optional)
If you want to use Python 3.12 as the default version, you can update the alternatives system.

Set Python 3.12 as an alternative:

bash
Copy code
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/local/bin/python3.12 1
Verify Python Version:

Check to ensure Python 3.12 is the default version.

bash
Copy code
python3 --version
